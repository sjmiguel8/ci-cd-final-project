# Testing the Tekton Pipeline on OpenShift

1. **Ensure Tekton is Installed**:
   Make sure that Tekton Pipelines is installed on your OpenShift cluster. You can check this by running:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n tekton-pipelines
   ```

2. **Create the Pipeline**:
   Save the pipeline YAML code to a file named `pipeline.yaml` and apply it using:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f pipeline.yaml
   ```

3. **Create a Workspace**:
   Ensure that the workspace named `output` is created. You can define it in your pipeline or create it separately if needed.

4. **Run the Pipeline**:
   Create a `PipelineRun` resource to trigger the pipeline. Save the following YAML to a file named `pipeline-run.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
   kind: PipelineRun
   metadata:
     name: example-pipeline-run
   spec:
     pipelineRef:
       name: example-pipeline
     workspaces:
       - name: output
         persistentVolumeClaim:
           claimName: your-pvc-name  # Replace with your PVC name
   ```
   Then apply it using:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f pipeline-run.yaml
   ```

5. **Monitor the Pipeline**:
   Check the status of the pipeline run with:
   ```
   kubectl get pipelineruns
   ```
   To see the logs of a specific task, use:
   ```
   kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
   ```

Replace `<pod-name>` with the name of the pod running the task you want to inspect.
